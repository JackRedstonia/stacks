# Stacks
A work-in-progress 2D game framework for the Rust programming language, similar to osu!framework. Prioritises composition over inheritance, and uses layout rules inspired from Godot, with parenting components being as authoritative as possible.

## Current state
Only graphics and input is available for now, audio is not yet implemented and is not the main focus.

The repository currently contains both a binary and a library. The binary crate is the example code for now.
